Control Signals:-

1.MemRead:- Memory reads the data present at address MAR and stores in MDR if the MemRead signal is set.
2.MemWrite:- Data present in MDR gets written at memory address MAR.
3.PCwrite:-If PCwrite is enabled then the data present in data bus gets written in PC.
4.IRwrite:-If IRwrite is enabled then the data present in data bus gets written in IR.
5.Regwrite:-If Regwrite is enabled then the data present in data bus gets written in Write register.
6.SourceA:- Select either data from databus or 0 will be selected for first opernad of ALU.
7.SourceB:- Select either data from databus from register B or 1 will be input for second operand of ALU.
8.FlagSelect:- Signal for selecting the flag on the basis of status bits.It will be 2bits
9.CondSignal:- Signal for checking if the jump is conditional or unconditional.It is 1 bit signal.
10.MDRsrc:-Signal for selecting data to be written to MDR.Either data from bus or data from read port of memory will get selected.
11.ALUop:-It is the input to ALU control unit.
12.MDRwrite:-If the signal is enabled then data from data bus or memory  gets written.
13.PCBus:-If the signal is enabled then PC gets dumped into data bus.
14.MABus:-If the signal is enabled then data of MAR gets dumped into memory address bus.
15.MD1BUS:-If the signal is enabled then data of MDR gets dumped into memory data bus.
16.RegSelect:-To select the read/write register from Instruction from IR to register file.
17.RegBwrite:-If the signal is enabled then data from data bus is written on Register B.
18.ALUBus:-If the signal is enabled then data from either ALUopt or ALU gets dumped into data bus.
19.RFBus:-If the signal is enabled then data read from register file gets dumped into data bus.
20.MD2Bus:-If the signal is enabled then data of MDR gets dumped into data bus.
